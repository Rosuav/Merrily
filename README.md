# Merrily
IP doorbell alert system
Named for the song in Princess Ida "Merrily ring the luncheon bell".

When the doorbell is pressed, a notification should appear on connected clients.

This project arose out of a personal need to make the household doorbell more
noticeable when no occupants are able to hear a normal ring.
The reference design includes a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B connected via the GPIO
pins to a charge-discharge circuit (details in merrily/doorbell.py), which in
turn is connected to the speaker leads on the doorbell. When a ring is detected,
any clients connected on port 8088 will be sent the string "Doorbell!". The
included `client.py` will listen for that string and send a desktop notification
using `notify-send`.

Also included is an optional web-based logging system built with Flask and
PostgreSQL, however, this requires more setup than the main notifier.

Installation
============

Tested on Ubuntu MATE 16.04 and up, but should work on any system with
Python 3.4+ (with venv and pip) and `notify-send`.
Install those from your package manager if they are not installed already.

Clone or download:
```
git clone https://github.com/stephenangelico/Merrily.git
cd Merrily
```

Create virtual environment (recommended):
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Log server setup (optional)
===========================

The log server requires a configured PostgreSQL server. Run these commands from
the installation directory or virtual environment.

Create database:
```
createdb merrily
```

Create a user for web interface:
```python
>>> import run
>>> run.adduser() # Follow the prompts then exit interpreter
```

Adjust `config.py` to your own needs. You probably also want to tell Git not to
look for changes to `config.py` as well:

```
git update-index --assume-unchanged merrily/config.py
```

Connecting to your doorbell
===========================

The reference design for this project uses a charge-discharge circuit made with
2 100KÎ© resistors and a 10nF capacitor. Information on creating this circuit can
be found [here](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/building-raspberry-pi-controllers-part-5-reading-analog-data-with-an-rpi/).
You don't need to follow it to the letter, but check a pinout diagram (such as
[this one](https://goo.gl/images/bU7u56)) and connect the wires to two GPIO pins
(green in the suggested diagram) and one ground (black in the same diagram).
Take note of which **GPIO** pins you are connecting to. This is not the same
as the geographical pin number. For instance, geographical pin 12 represents
GPIO pin 18. Replace the values for `a_pin` and `b_pin` in `doorbell.py` with
those you took note of.

Next you need to establish your threshold for what represents a ringing signal.
`doorbell.py` has some functions to help you figure out the level you need.
Normally, it runs as a daemon and not interactively, so run it in an interactive
Python session (from the virtual environment):

```
python -i merrily/doorbell.py
```

Then press Control-C to send a `KeyboardInterrupt` and get an interactive
interpreter.

TODO: fix up imports, relative and absolute, such that this is again a simple
import into the interpreter.

Once you have the Python prompt `>>>`, you can call one of the test
functions:

```python
>>> test_ring()
120
120.9
120.65
120.975
```

This function does the same thing as the main looping function (but with print()
calls so you know what's going on) - calculate the average time to charge over
the last second. Look at this number when the doorbell is silent, then watch the
value as you press the doorbell.

Pick a boundary value to replace the value in the `if` statement in the function
and test it this way until it correctly rings for every ring and does not ring
at other times.

Depending on which way the speaker is attached to the circuit, a signal on the
line may cause the charge time to become high or low. Check that the operator
is correct for this situation. So if a ring causes the level to drop, a ring
event should trigger if the level becomes less than (<) a particular value.

Once you have settled on a value, copy it to the main function, `ring_listen()`,
and the hardware should be good to go.

Running
=======

Run all commands in the virtual environment.

Main doorbell daemon:
```python merrily/doorbell.py```

Web logging server:
```python run.py```

Client to receive notifications:
```python merrily/client.py```
Make sure to specify the correct host to connect to.
